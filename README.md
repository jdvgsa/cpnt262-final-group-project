## Search Notes

Initial Search Term Used was "How to use dayJS with svelte".

- This search term was not very efficient as it didn't provide narrow resources and results.

Optimized Search term used "how to display date and time dayjs".

- This search term brought me to this link: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-date-time-dayjs/#:~:text=format('YYYY-MM-,and%20logged%20out%20the%20ouput]

I have never used dayJS before so I needed to do research on how to use it for our project. The link has an in-depth guide on how to use dayJS such as modifying different times and dates in order to display whichever you might need.
